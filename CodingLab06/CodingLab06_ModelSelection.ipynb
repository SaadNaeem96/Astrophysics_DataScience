The extreme regularity of these pulses means that pulsars function as extremely good clocks. This makes the binary system a great laboratory for relativity. In relativity we often think about how hypothetical clocks behave; with a pulsar, Nature has provided us with an actual clock that has regular \"ticks\" (the pulses) that we can measure!"

What's shown here is what's called the \"cumulative shift of periastron time\". The periastron of the binary orbit is the point of the orbit where the two stars are the closest together. Because of the decay of the orbit from gravitational wave emission, the orbit reaches periastron earlier and earlier with every orbit. Over time, this effect accumulates compared to if there wasn't any gravitational wave emission, and that's what the plot shows:\n",

Amazing how perfectly GR passes this experimental test! Prior to LIGO's results, the Hulse-Taylor binary was our best evidence for the existence of gravitational waves."

    "You should find that the data really does prefer a particular value for $\\varepsilon$, so it's possible to get a sense for the error bars from the data! This may seem like magic---how can we figure out the error bars with no error information to begin with? What's really happening is that our analysis is using the scatter of our data points. Imagine I gave you a bunch of points with no error bars and asked you to fit a straight line through them. You could probably look at the distance between your best-fit line and the data points and roughly guess how big the error bars are. This is essentially what's going on here, in a more statistically disciplined fashion. In general, it's best if you have accurately estimated error bars from your measurements that you can just use. But this is a handy trick if you're in a pinch. Another interesting technique is to multiply all parameters with some parameter $\\eta$, such that $\\sigma_i \\rightarrow \\eta \\sigma_i$. This new parameter is now another free parameter in our fitting exercise. If the posterior is peaked around $\\eta \\approx 1$, then the errors have been correctly estimated. If $\\eta > 1$, the errors have been underestimated."

    "In completing this exercise, you probably found that with a reasonably fine ``np.linspace`` grid, it took a little time for your code to run. This problem gets worse and worse as we include more and more parameters in our model because of what's known as \"the curse of dimensionality\". For example, if we have two parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and we want to evaluate the posterior on a grid with $100$ points along the $\\alpha$ axis and $100$ points along the $\\beta$ axis, we end up having to evaluate $N = 100^2$ points. But if we had a $12$ free parameters, we would need to evaluate $N = 100^{12}$ points! This is not very practical from a computational standpoint. Next lecture we will begin learning about __*Markov Chain Monte Carlo*__ techniques that allow us to bypass this problem."
