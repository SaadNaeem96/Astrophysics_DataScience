The Friedman equation connects the energy density of our Universe ($\\rho$, which remember, changes with time as our Universe expands) to the expansion rate of our Universe. The total energy density can be broken down into the various constituents of our Universe, such that $\\rho_m$ is the energy density of matter, $\\rho_r$ is the energy density of radiation (e.g., photons), and $\\rho_\\Lambda$ is the energy density of dark energy (i.e., the mysterious vacuum energy that is causing our Universe's expansion to accelerate, which nobody understands). The quantity $H$ is known as the _Hubble parameter_. Suppose we assume that galaxies are just \"glued\" onto a particular coordinate location on the fabric of an expanding spacetime. Under this assumption, the motion of galaxies is due only to the fact that $a(t)$ is increasing with time---it is \"scaling up\" all distances like the name \"scale factor\" would suggest. This means that the distance $d$ to some faraway galaxy is proportional to $a(t)$, whereas its velocity is proportional to $\\dot{a}$. Using $H \\equiv \\dot{a} / a$ then gives the empirical version of Hubble's Law that Hubble discovered:\n",

The units may seem funny, but they're very helpful for observers. Suppose I am looking at a bunch of different galaxies, each at a different distance away from me. Hubble's Law says that the further away a galaxy is, the more quickly it is receding from me. Intuitively, this is because the recession of galaxies is due to the expansion of space between a galaxy and me. Each little bit of space expands by the same amount, so the more space there is between us (i.e., the farther way the galaxy is), the bigger the effect of this expansion and the more quickly we fly apart. To say that $H_0 \\sim 70\\,\\frac{\\textrm{km}/\\textrm{s}}{\\textrm{Mpc}}$ is then saying that for every extra $\\textrm{Mpc}$ of distance between me and a distant galaxy, we get an extra $70\\,\\textrm{km}/\\textrm{s}$ of speed pulling us apart."

A galaxies velocity is the sum of their own recessional velocity i.e due to the expansion of the spatial coordinates and their own peculiar velocity (irrespective of the expansion of the universe). For distant galaxies, their peculair velocities is small enough to be ignored, and os this assumption holds in that case, but for nearby galxies their peculiar velocities can be larger than the expansion of the universe, and hence this assumption doesnt hold.

This is really just a fancy way of writing the Pythagorean theorem: it's an instruction that says that if I want to know the distance between two points, I take the difference between the $x$-coordinates, square it, and add to the $y$-coordinate difference squared etc. I can equivalently write this in terms of spherical coordinates:\n",

    "One important thing about the metric is that light travels along paths that have $ds^2 = 0$. As an example, imagine that we have a photon travelling purely in the $x$ direction, so that $dy = dz = 0$. Setting $ds^2 = 0$ then tells us that $dx/dt = c$, which is precisely what we expect.\n",

    "In general relativity, the fact that light travels along paths with $ds^2 =0$ continues to be true. But the metric gets more complicated. Luckily, for our current purposes, it's not too bad. For example, to account for the expanding universe, all I have to do is to insert a factor of the scale factor $a(t)$ in front of the spatial parts (becuase it's space that's expanding):\n",

    "Now let's talk about how this works when it comes to distances that we might be able to observably measure. It turns out that in cosmology there are different ways of definining distances to an object, and these different definitions give different answers! One way we can define a distance is to imagine we have some **standard ruler** with a known length (e.g., $1\\,\\textrm{m}$). Then the smaller the ruler appears (see image above), the farther away it is. To make this more precise, if we know $D$ in the diagram below, we can measure $\\delta \\theta$ and do some geometry to determine how far away the ruler is."

The power of this source is spread of a sphere of surface area $4 \\pi s^2 = 4 \\pi a(t_0) r_1^2$ (using similar manipulations as we used in Equation 1). But not only are the photons spread out over a sphere, but as they travel towards us, they are *redshifted*. Since $E= hf = hc/\\lambda$, each photon's energy gets multiplied by a ratio of $a(t_1) / a(t_0)$ (i.e., it ends up smaller). It turns out that there is an additional factor of $a(t_1) / a(t_0)$ due to time dilation---if two photons are initially emitted at some time interval $\\delta t$ apart, they will be received at an interval $\\delta t a(t_0)/ a(t_1)$ apart. This is greater than $\\delta t$ [remember that $t_0$ stands for the present time, so $a(t_0) > a(t_1)$], so this reduces the rate of reception of photons.

    "Answer: The turning point in the \"Angular Diameter Distance\" plot and tne the subsequent decline was surprising. It has a turn-over point at red shift approximately equal to 2. This happens due to the expansion of the universe at larger red shifts which causes the angular diameter distance to decrease"

    "Supernovae are explosive deaths of massive stars. Measurements of supernovae can be used to empirically measure $D_L$, and thus to constrain the values of cosmological parameters:\n",
    "1. A special type of supernova are known as \"Type Ia\". These supernovae are *standardizable candles*. Recall that a standard candle is a class of object where every example of this type of astronomical object has a known intrinsic luminosity $L$. A standardizable candle is one where the object becomes a standard candle once some small corrections are made to the observations. With a known luminosity $L$ and an observed flux $F$, we can compute $D_L$ using Equation (3).\n",
    "2. If we have a large number of supernovae over a variety of redshifts, we end up with an empirical measurement of $D_L(z)$, i.e., the LHS of Equation (4). The redshifts can be obtained by taking spectra of the host galaxies of the observed supernovae.\n",
    "3. We can then plug in different combinations of cosmological parameters for the RHS of Equation (4) to arrive at a prediction for $D_L(z)$. The combination that fits the data best represents our set of best-fitting cosmological parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of Equation (4) as an advanced version of the Hubble Law. To see this, note that at $z \\ll 1$ where the Hubble Law holds, we have $z \\sim v / c$. This means that we can write the Hubble Law as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "d = \\frac{c}{H_0} z,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "which is of the same form as Equation (2), with a distance on the LHS and a RHS proportional to $c/H_0$. The differnce, of course, is the plain Hubble Law is proportional to $z$, whereas Equation (4) has a much more complicated function of $z$."

Included in the directory for this Coding Lab is a file called ``SCPUnion2.1_mu_vs_z.txt``. We will use the data in the file to convince ourselves that $\\Omega_\\Lambda >0$ (or equivalently, that our Universe's expansion is accelerating), which is what got Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt, and Adam Reiss the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics."

    "**Exercise:** Recreate the classic plot shown below, which is taken from [Reiss et al. (1998)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300499/meta), but using the more recent Union 2.1 data. Notice that the vertical axis is *not* the luminosity distance. It is the distance modulus $m-M = 5 \\log_{10} D_L + 25$, where $D_L$ is measured in Mpc (can you figure out how to get this formula from the one we used in class?) You may want to pick slightly different cosmological parameters than Reiss et al. did. At this point, there is no need to actually do a proper fit for the different cosmological parameters. We will return to this later in the course."
