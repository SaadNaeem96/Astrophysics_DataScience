The Friedman equation connects the energy density of our Universe ($\\rho$, which remember, changes with time as our Universe expands) to the expansion rate of our Universe. The total energy density can be broken down into the various constituents of our Universe, such that $\\rho_m$ is the energy density of matter, $\\rho_r$ is the energy density of radiation (e.g., photons), and $\\rho_\\Lambda$ is the energy density of dark energy (i.e., the mysterious vacuum energy that is causing our Universe's expansion to accelerate, which nobody understands). The quantity $H$ is known as the _Hubble parameter_. Suppose we assume that galaxies are just \"glued\" onto a particular coordinate location on the fabric of an expanding spacetime. Under this assumption, the motion of galaxies is due only to the fact that $a(t)$ is increasing with time---it is \"scaling up\" all distances like the name \"scale factor\" would suggest. This means that the distance $d$ to some faraway galaxy is proportional to $a(t)$, whereas its velocity is proportional to $\\dot{a}$. Using $H \\equiv \\dot{a} / a$ then gives the empirical version of Hubble's Law that Hubble discovered:\n",

The units may seem funny, but they're very helpful for observers. Suppose I am looking at a bunch of different galaxies, each at a different distance away from me. Hubble's Law says that the further away a galaxy is, the more quickly it is receding from me. Intuitively, this is because the recession of galaxies is due to the expansion of space between a galaxy and me. Each little bit of space expands by the same amount, so the more space there is between us (i.e., the farther way the galaxy is), the bigger the effect of this expansion and the more quickly we fly apart. To say that $H_0 \\sim 70\\,\\frac{\\textrm{km}/\\textrm{s}}{\\textrm{Mpc}}$ is then saying that for every extra $\\textrm{Mpc}$ of distance between me and a distant galaxy, we get an extra $70\\,\\textrm{km}/\\textrm{s}$ of speed pulling us apart."

    "This assumption is not correct. A galaxies velocity is the sum of their own recessional velocity i.e due to the expansion of the spatial coordinates, and their own peculiar velocity (irrespective of the expansion of the universe). For distant galaxies, their peculair velocities is small enough to be ignored, and os this assumption holds in that case, but for nearby galxies their peculiar velocities can be larger than the expansion of the universe, and hence this assumption doesnt hold.

    "The Hubble parameter, however, is notoriously difficult to measure. In fact, the last couple of years have been very interesting for researchers who try to measure $H_0$ using different methods.

Unfortunately, the quantities that we have worked out so far (the scale factor $a$ and the age $t$) are not direclty observable quantities.
