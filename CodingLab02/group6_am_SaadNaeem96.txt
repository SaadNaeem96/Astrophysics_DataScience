3/3	understanding of Hubble flow and peculiar velocity

1.5/2	
    1/1 Using matplotlib
    1/1 estimate Age using Plank.age() function
        -0.5: You have code but not ran it? Is this a simple copy-paste?

2/2	
    1/1 Using z_at_value() function
    1/1 maths of subtracting his/her age

5/6	
    3/3 Basic knowledge of Hubble–Lemaître law
    2/3 order-of-magnitude calculation
        Hardcoding values makes it hard to understand what you're doing

18/18	
    1/1 Matplotlib use
    10/10 final plot
    6/6 estimate age using different cosmologies
    1/1 basic code structure

11/15	
    1/1 Matplotlib use
    8/10 final plot
        Hard to compare both plots as different plots/y scale
    0/2 use of Planck15.luminosity_distance()
    2/2 Planck15.angular_diameter_distance(z)
4/4	D(A) starts decreasing (optional: non-linear distance scale)

11/15	
    1/1 matplotlib use
    6/10 final plot
        Why is it not linear?
    1/1 loading data
    2/2 converting to (m-M) values
    1/1 basic code structure

4/4
